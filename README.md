# IOT-BASED-PATIENT-MONITORING-SYSTEM
The Internet of Things technology has led to the development of various innovative solutions for healthcare. In this article, we will explore the creation of a Health Monitoring System using the Blynk App, ESP32 Board, MAX30100 Sensor, DHT11 Sensor, and DS18B20 Sensor.
Now we demonstrate how to build an IoT-based patient health monitoring system using the ESP32 microcontroller and the Blynk app. This project is designed to continuously monitor vital health parameters like heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen levels. The data is sent to the Blynk app in real time, allowing remote monitoring from anywhere.
